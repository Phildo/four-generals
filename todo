- host/join specified port
- sensible text popups

- can back out when auto-join attempting
- shouldn't try auto-join unless ip exists
- notification of wireless status would be nice

- switch model "hasX, getX" to bool X(&X)
- message + sabotage reading
- playscene ui rendering not brute

- android no ip? (can't host)
- android startup to gray screen
- android freeze on disconnect
